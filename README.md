The purpose of this project is to automate testing for an e-commerce website using Selenium WebDriver in conjunction with the TestNG testing framework. The TestNG framework will provide efficient test execution, parallel test execution capabilities, and comprehensive reporting. The primary objectives are to improve testing efficiency, increase test coverage, and ensure the reliability of the e-commerce platform. Key components of the project scope include:

1. Test Environment Setup:

Establish a test environment with Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and any other required dependencies.
Configure the test environment to enable parallel test execution for faster feedback.
2. Test Case Identification and Prioritization:

Collaborate with stakeholders to identify and prioritize test cases based on critical functionalities, business logic, and user workflows.
Categorize tests into suites, allowing for selective and efficient test execution.
3. Selenium WebDriver Scripting with TestNG Annotations:

Develop Selenium WebDriver scripts using the appropriate programming language (e.g., Java) and integrate TestNG annotations for test configuration and execution.
Utilize annotations such as @Test, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest, and others to define test methods and set up/tear down procedures.
4. Functional Testing:

Automate functional tests for core e-commerce features, including product browsing, search functionality, product details, shopping cart management, and checkout processes.
Leverage TestNG assertions to validate expected outcomes.
